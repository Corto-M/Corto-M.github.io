# About

I am a PhD student in LaBRI, Bordeaux, under the supervision of [Anca Muscholl](https://www.labri.fr/perso/anca/) and [Igor Walukiewicz](https://www.labri.fr/perso/igw/). My thesis is about monitoring and control problems over models of distributed systems, but I am interested in everything related to automata, logics and games.
